# Pair programming demo

## Summary

As part of the Maker's Academy pre-course, we were each provided with a senior student as a mentor, who arranged a pair programming session. My mentor was [Denise Yu](https://github.com/deniseyu). This was my first experience of pair programming, which was done remotely via a Google Hangout.

It was also my first experience of some basic TDD using Rspec and Ruby.
